# Clue  (ou detetive pros BR)
This is a C version of the game clue. Why have I done it ? Mostly because of two reasons 
### College
I had to do this to college, but I was originally going to make it as simple as possible,
for time saving purposes. But then The second reason hit me and I wanted to make it as good as I could

### Web Assembly 
If you follow me on [dev.to](https://dev.to/gabrieleloy) you should know  that I am releasing a series of articles
talking about web assebly. The name of the series is [web assembly from zero to hero](https://dev.to/gabrieleloy/web-assembly-from-zero-to-hero-part-1-11fo)

At the point I'm finishing this project I've only released the first article, which is a theorical one, explaining the concept of web assembly, why it's interesting,
and his use cases.

For the second part I  want to release a pratical project, covering how to compile code to web assembly, and I would to have something fun (and made by me, because I
hate when 12948038904 tutorials of a language/framework/whatever cover how to do the exact same thing), to deploy to a website and allow people to play with it.

If you are in a point of time where I have already release the article and hosted this application in a web site using [**wasm**](https://webassembly.org/)

The link to both of these things will be here
